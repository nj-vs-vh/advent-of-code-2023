# Advent of Code 2023

This year I've decided to pause my attempts to learn Rust and just focus on solving the challenges.
I'm going to use Python, which I know and love, and to make my solutions
- clean
- readable
- fully typed
- reasonably performant
- zero-dependency (except for visualizations, which are done separately)
- single-threaded Python

```shell
python run.py <day number> [--debug [--input custom-input.txt [--part 1]]]
```

## Performance measurement

Just for fun, this year I'm keeping track of how long my solutions take to run. Later I might take some time to
optimize them and update the numbers.

Methodology:
- Measured time: between the moment string input is read from the disk and the moment the answer is calculated
- Each part is measured independently, no data is shared between parts (i.e. input parsing is included in both times)
- Averaged over 30 runs
- System: 2021 Mac M1 Pro 16 Gb
